I'm a software engineer at Google, working on design tools. 

This is mainly a place for me to collect my (oftentimes faulty, I'm sure) solutions to various different materials that I am working through. If you find any errors, please let me know either via email or via a pull request. 

You can find the source code for a lot of the exercise solutions on [my github.](https://github.com/kevinlindkvist/)
