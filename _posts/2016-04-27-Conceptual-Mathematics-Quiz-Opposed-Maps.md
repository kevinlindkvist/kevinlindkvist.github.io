### **Question 0**

#### $A\underset{g}{\overset{f}{\rightleftarrows}}B$

#### Fill in the blanks; when $\boxed{\textbf{vs}?}$ occurs, cross out the false alternative.

### **Question 1**

#### Given two maps $f,g$ with domains and codomains as above, we can ($\enclose{horizontalstrike}{\text{sometimes}} \boxed{\textbf{vs}?}$ always) form the composites $g\circ{f}$ and $f\circ{g}$. All we can say about $g\circ{f}$ and $f\circ{g}$ as maps in themselves is that they are $\underline{endomaps}$.

### **Question 2**

#### If we know that $g$ is a retraction for $f$, that means $g\circ{f}$ is actually $\underline{1_A}$; then we can prove that $f\circ{g}$ is not only an $\underline{isomorphism}$, but actually an $\underline{idempotent}$. The latter means that the equation $\underline{f\circ{g}\circ{f}\circ{g}=f\circ{g}}$ is true.

### **Question 3**

#### If we even know that $f$ is an isomorphism *and* that $g\circ{f}=1_A$, then $f\circ{g}$ is not only an idempotent, but is $\underline{unique}$. If, moreover, $s$ is a map for which $f\circ{s}=1_B$, we can conclude that $s=\underline{g}$.

### **Question 4** 

#### Going back to $0$, i.e. assuming no equations, but only the domain and codomain statements about $f$ and $g$, the composite $f\circ{g}\circ{f}$ (could be different from $\boxed{\textbf{vs}?} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{\text{must be the same as}}$) $f$. Likewise $f\circ{g}\circ{f}\circ{g}$ (could be different from $\boxed{\textbf{vs}?} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{\text{must be the same as}}$) $f\circ{g}$.
